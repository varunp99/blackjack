The running of the the Release version of the Blackjack game. We are using
text-based interactions between the player and the dealer (computer).
Our code makes use of ANSITerminal and Emoji Packages. Please refer below for
installing packages and running the game:
  

1.  To successfully run this program, please ensure you have downloaded
OCaml packages as instructed on the CS 3110 Course Website.
https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs3110/2020sp/install.html.
The beta version uses ANSITerminal package.

2. We also use the Emoji Package for displaying the visuals for the game. 
Before running the program, please download the package using the following 
command on terminal.

3.  Please ensure you have unzipped the zip file from the CMSX and
extracted all the files in a new directory. We use multiple modules for the
program so all files must be in the same directory.

4.  Open terminal/command line and type in the following commands:

Move into the directory with the downloaded game files.

    ```

    $  cd /PATH/OF/DIR
    $  make build

This will launch the game in terminal. Please make your terminal window wide to enjoy the game!
